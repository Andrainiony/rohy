**In a family, communication is crucial**. It creates the bonds between each person in the family. Elsewhere, good links generate more communication.
The problem is that sometimes we forget to spend time with our family when there are various activities that we could do as a family like games, cooking, gardening, etc.
I created this application in order to highlight these strong points which strengthen the cohesion and fluidity of household communication.
With this application you will not forget to spend moments together with your family, even more beautiful, you can record them to get a good memory about it
Rohy is a **Malagasy word meaning Link**, it is created with *native React*.
when i wrote it, the features i wanted to have are:
1. Score recording during games
2. Ranking of the best players
3. Ranking of the best participants (who participates the most)
4. Game tools (Times, Dice, spinner)
5. Schedulling pary <br/>
If you have any idea to make this app better and funier, you are all welcome <br/>
P.S : This it the first app I wrote with react native
